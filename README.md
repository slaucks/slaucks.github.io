This is my new GitHub account. It will contain my work from Web, Pgm, & Db Foundation.

I created the repository "slaucks.github.io" and have moved a few html scripts in there. 

To clone the repository, I selected the "+" on the top icon on the top left corner and selected "slaucks.github.io" from the list.
I then selected my local folder for this class as the save location. Then I slected "Clone respository"
